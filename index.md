#My first day of using Pop_os  
##Day1
The thing is that it is similar to the fedora but the working of the system is different  
i am just reading the documentation of system76 and there is not much to write it down and remember for me  
so i will just not write anything today may be tommorow since i will be busy from 9:20  
and lets talk about today just used kiss launcher in phone  
and the best part of it is the invisibility feature of it so good  
only i know where my privates are and thats it for today lets see you tommorow  
and i will study about the book of math i was intrested and write about it soon  
##Day2
fucking hell the orca is hell well i found that to enable it you need  
(orca) to start and (killall orca) to terminate it  
Customixe the shorcut so it is easier for you to do things  
so i just found that there are various desktop environment most are Gui  
and they are  
1. kde  
2. cinnamon  
3. Gnome  
4. Ukui  
5. xfce
